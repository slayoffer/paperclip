# Implementation specification: part 1

## 1. Document Role

`SPEC.md` remains the long-horizon product spec.
This document is the concrete, build-ready V1 contract.
When there is a conflict, `SPEC-implementation.md` controls V1 behavior.

## 2. V1 Outcomes

Paperclip V1 must provide a full control-plane loop for autonomous agents:

1. A human board creates a company and defines goals.
2. The board creates and manages agents in an org tree.
3. Agents receive and execute tasks via heartbeat invocations.
4. All work is tracked through tasks/comments with audit visibility.
5. Token/cost usage is reported and budget limits can stop work.
6. The board can intervene anywhere (pause agents/tasks, override decisions).
   An effective task or ancestor pause replaces the message composer with an
   amber Resume takeover. New board messages, including updates with comments,
   are rejected until the hold is released. Drafts survive pause and resume.

Success means one operator can run a small AI-native company end-to-end with clear visibility and control.

## 3. Explicit V1 Product Decisions

These decisions close open questions from `SPEC.md` for V1.

| Topic | V1 Decision |
|---|---|
| Tenancy | Single-tenant deployment, multi-company data model |
| Company model | Company is first-order; all business entities are company-scoped |
| Board | Single human board operator per deployment |
| Org graph | Strict tree (`reports_to` nullable root); no multi-manager reporting |
| Visibility | Company-scoped visibility: board + all in-company agents can see all work objects by default; public/private deployment flags affect external exposure only and do **not** imply project/issue privacy |
| Communication | Tasks + comments only (no separate chat system) |
| Task ownership | Single assignee; atomic checkout required for `in_progress` transition |
| Task watchdogs | A task watchdog is an explicitly configured, issue-subtree-scoped verification and recovery capacity. It may restore live task paths inside the watched subtree; for issue-thread interaction resolution it is an ordinary agent subject to the same audience and containment checks, not board authority, active-run output monitoring, or general liveness recovery. |
| Recovery | Liveness/watchdog recovery preserves explicit ownership: continue interrupted local conversations with bounded fresh turns and preserved history, never replay tool calls automatically; retain native ownership and real execution gates; preserve verified stop evidence and reconsider saved post-stop user messages after cleanup; otherwise open visible source-scoped recovery actions by default, use issue-backed recovery only for independent repair work, or require human escalation (see `doc/execution-semantics.md`) |
| Agent adapters | Built-in `process`, `http`, local CLI/session adapters, and OpenClaw gateway support; external adapters can also be loaded through the adapter plugin flow |
| Plugin framework | Local/self-hosted early plugin runtime is in scope; cloud marketplace and packaged public distribution remain out of scope |
| Auth | Mode-dependent human auth (`local_trusted` implicit board in current code; authenticated mode uses sessions), API keys for agents |
| Budget period | Monthly UTC calendar window |
| Budget enforcement | Soft alerts + hard limit auto-pause |
| Deployment modes | Canonical model is `local_trusted` + `authenticated` with `private/public` exposure policy (see `doc/DEPLOYMENT-MODES.md`) |

Low-trust agent presets are containment controls for hostile automated work, not
general project or issue privacy controls. The core preset resolver contract is
documented in `doc/LOW-TRUST-PRESETS.md`.

## 4. Current Baseline (Repo Snapshot)

As of 2026-02-17, the repo already includes:

- Node + TypeScript backend with REST CRUD for `agents`, `projects`, `goals`, `issues`, `activity`
- React UI pages for dashboard/agents/projects/goals/issues lists
- PostgreSQL schema via Drizzle with embedded PostgreSQL fallback when `DATABASE_URL` is unset

V1 implementation extends this baseline into a company-centric, governance-aware control plane.

## 5. V1 Scope

## 5.1 In Scope

- Company lifecycle (create/list/get/update/archive)
- Goal hierarchy linked to company mission
- Agent lifecycle with org structure and adapter configuration
- Task lifecycle with parent/child hierarchy and comments
- Atomic task checkout and explicit task status transitions
- Board approvals for hires and CEO strategy proposal
- Heartbeat invocation, status tracking, and cancellation
- Cost event ingestion and rollups (agent/task/project/company)
- Budget settings and hard-stop enforcement
- Board web UI for dashboard, org chart, tasks, agents, approvals, costs
- Agent-facing API contract (task read/write, heartbeat report, cost report)
- Auditable activity log for all mutating actions

## 5.2 Out of Scope (V1)

- Cloud-grade plugin marketplace/distribution beyond the local/self-hosted plugin runtime
- Revenue/expense accounting beyond model/token costs
- Knowledge base subsystem
- Public marketplace (ClipHub)
- Multi-board governance (multiple board UIs for a single company)
- Automatic self-healing orchestration (auto-reassign/retry planners)

Role-based human permission granularity is V1 — see the `humans-and-permissions`
plan, the `principal_permission_grants` table, and the `PERMISSION_KEYS` set
in `packages/shared/src/constants.ts`.

## 6. Architecture

## 6.1 Runtime Components

- `server/`: REST API, auth, orchestration services
- `ui/`: Board operator interface
- `packages/db/`: Drizzle schema, migrations, DB clients (Postgres)
- `packages/shared/`: Shared API types, validators, constants

## 6.2 Data Stores

- Primary: PostgreSQL
- Local default: embedded PostgreSQL at `~/.paperclip/instances/default/db`
- Optional local prod-like: Docker Postgres
- Optional hosted: Supabase/Postgres-compatible
- File/object storage:
  - local default: `~/.paperclip/instances/default/data/storage` (`local_disk`)
  - cloud: S3-compatible object storage (`s3`)

## 6.3 Background Processing

A lightweight scheduler/worker in the server process handles:

- heartbeat trigger checks
- stuck run detection
- budget threshold checks

Separate queue infrastructure is not required for V1.

## 7. Canonical Data Model (V1)

All core tables include `id`, `created_at`, `updated_at` unless noted.

## 7.0 Auth Tables

Human auth tables (`users`, `sessions`, and provider-specific auth artifacts) are managed by the selected auth library. This spec treats them as required dependencies and references `users.id` where user attribution is needed.

## 7.1 `companies`

- `id` uuid pk
- `name` text not null
- `description` text null
- `status` enum: `active | paused | archived`
- `pause_reason` text null
- `paused_at` timestamptz null
- `issue_prefix` text not null
- `issue_counter` int not null
- `budget_monthly_cents` int not null default 0
- `spent_monthly_cents` int not null default 0
- `require_board_approval_for_new_agents` boolean not null default false
- feedback sharing consent fields

Invariant: every business record belongs to exactly one company.

## 7.2 `agents`

- `id` uuid pk
- `company_id` uuid fk `companies.id` not null
- `name` text not null
- `role` text not null
- `title` text null
- `icon` text null
- `status` enum: `active | paused | idle | running | error | pending_approval | terminated`
- `reports_to` uuid fk `agents.id` null
- `capabilities` text null
- `adapter_type` text; built-ins include `process`, `http`, `claude_local`, `codex_local`, `gemini_local`, `opencode_local`, `pi_local`, `cursor`, `hermes_local`, `hermes_gateway`, and `openclaw_gateway`
- `adapter_config` jsonb not null
- `runtime_config` jsonb not null default `{}`; contains Paperclip runtime policy such as heartbeat scheduling and debug settings
- `default_environment_id` uuid fk `environments.id` null
- `context_mode` enum: `thin | fat` default `thin`
- `budget_monthly_cents` int not null default 0
- `spent_monthly_cents` int not null default 0
- pause fields: `pause_reason`, `paused_at`
- `permissions` jsonb not null default `{}`
- `last_heartbeat_at` timestamptz null
- `metadata` jsonb null

Invariants:

- agent and manager must be in same company
- no cycles in reporting tree
- `terminated` agents cannot be resumed

## 7.3 `agent_api_keys`

- `id` uuid pk
- `agent_id` uuid fk `agents.id` not null
- `company_id` uuid fk `companies.id` not null
- `name` text not null
- `key_hash` text not null
- `last_used_at` timestamptz null
- `revoked_at` timestamptz null

Invariant: plaintext key shown once at creation; only hash stored.

## 7.4 `goals`

- `id` uuid pk
- `company_id` uuid fk not null
- `title` text not null
- `description` text null
- `level` enum: `company | team | agent | task`
- `parent_id` uuid fk `goals.id` null
- `owner_agent_id` uuid fk `agents.id` null
- `status` enum: `planned | active | achieved | cancelled`

Invariant: at least one root `company` level goal per company.

## 7.5 `projects`

- `id` uuid pk
- `company_id` uuid fk not null
- `goal_id` uuid fk `goals.id` null
- `name` text not null
- `description` text null
- `status` enum: `backlog | planned | in_progress | completed | cancelled`
- `lead_agent_id` uuid fk `agents.id` null
- `target_date` date null
- `env` jsonb null (same secret-aware env binding format used by agent config)

Invariant:

- project env is merged into run environment for issues in that project and overrides conflicting agent env keys before Paperclip runtime-owned keys are injected

Routine execution issues add a routine-scoped env overlay after project env and before Paperclip runtime-owned keys. Routine env uses the same secret-aware binding format, is stored on `routines.env`, is snapshotted in routine revisions, and resolves secret refs against the routine binding target so routine-owned secrets do not require direct bindings on the executing agent.

Project source repositories use the existing `project_workspaces` collection.
Each selected GitHub repository has a canonical `repo_url` and stable provider ID
in `metadata.githubRepositoryId`; the first workspace remains the execution default.
The board can select multiple repositories from its usable personal and shared
GitHub grants. Selection does not grant runtime credential access. Legacy workspace
URLs remain valid. Project creation and repository replacement are transactional.
See `doc/project-repositories.md` for the API and UI contract.
