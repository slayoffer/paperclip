# Database: part 3

## Legacy controller ownership

Legacy run claims atomically record `controller_boot_id`, a database-clock
`controller_lease_expires_at`, and `execution_stage` before workspace provisioning.
The lease renews independently of output. A different container must not infer
controller death from its own process map or numeric PIDs. Expiration grants
cleanup authority; it does not prove that remote inference has stopped. Recovery
revokes the previous boot identity with a conditional update. Its own claim also
expires so another sweep can finish cleanup after a restart. Historical rows keep
null ownership fields and follow the previous recovery path.

## Agent file persistence and legacy revisions

Managed agent files are current filesystem contents, using the same persistent
instance storage as other workspaces. `agent_instruction_revisions` and
`agent_instruction_heads` are retained as read-only upgrade input. Their heads
are adopted once into the managed directory; new saves never append revisions.
`agent_instruction_working_copies` holds per-run baseline hashes, state, and
capture receipts. New receipts identify `paperclip.agent-files.v1`; historical
rows retain the instruction-only format. Completed directory runs discard their
baseline and private copies. See [Persistent agent files](../agent-files.md).

## Large API response snapshots

`assets.byte_size` uses PostgreSQL `bigint` so saved responses and byte ranges can
exceed 2 GiB. The API and Drizzle mapping continue to expose a JavaScript number;
response readers validate safe integer offsets. The type-widening migration
rewrites the asset metadata table and needs an exclusive table lock. File bytes
remain in local or object storage.

### Runner API response reservations

`runner_api_response_reservations` holds company-scoped API snapshot reservations.
Before a capture spills, the server locks company admission and counts stored
`runner-api` assets plus unattached reservations against a 20 GiB default quota.
A committed asset replaces its reservation in that total. The asset foreign key
cascades on deletion, while deleting a run sets `run_id` to null so an orphan
reservation cannot silently disappear. Failed cleanup or an ambiguous storage
write requires operator reconciliation before an unattached reservation is
removed. The table stores no response bodies. See `doc/runner-api-tools.md` for
limits and the operator override.
