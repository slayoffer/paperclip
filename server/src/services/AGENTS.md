## Deferred dependency wakes

Durable wake payloads describe the blocker set at release time.
The saved blocker set can differ from the current blocker set during a retry.
Check current blocker membership before reusing a saved resolved-blocker ID.
Use current dependency readiness and its blocked-cycle key for dispatch and duplicate checks.
